Overview

Writing an overview or a preview of the upcoming sections in the introduction for a short research article in computer science involves summarizing the major points that will be discussed in the body of the article. The overview will provide your readers with a roadmap of your research, which will help them to understand the flow of your argument, the importance of your research, and the novelty of your findings.

Here are the steps you can follow to write the overview:

•	Briefly Mention the Main Topics: In the overview, briefly mention the main topics or points that will be discussed in the article. These should follow the order in which they appear in the article.
•	Describe the Methodology: Briefly describe the method or approach you will take to address the problem.
•	Preview the Results: Give a glimpse of the results or findings, but do not go into detail. This will create interest and encourage readers to continue reading.
•	Mention the Structure: Briefly explain the structure of the paper. This helps the reader navigate through the content and understand the progression of your argument.

Here is a generic example for a computer science article:

This research article explores the potential of blockchain technology in bolstering data security in cloud computing environments. Section 1 provides an in-depth discussion on the current security challenges in cloud computing. Section 2 introduces blockchain technology, focusing on its inherent security features. In Section 3, a novel blockchain-based security framework for cloud data storage is proposed and its implementation steps are detailed. Section 4 presents a series of tests that evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with results indicating an enhanced level of data security. Finally, Section 5 discusses the broader implications of these findings and potential avenues for future research.

Remember, the objective of the overview is to guide your reader, making it easier for them to understand the content of your article. Be clear and concise, and avoid going into too much detail.
