Three main tenses

The most frequently used tenses and aspects in computer science writing are the present simple, present perfect simple, and past simple tenses. Here is an explanation for each tense's usage:

Present Simple: This tense is used to discuss concepts that are true now and generally remain true. It helps readers understand fundamental ideas and current developments in computer science.

Example: "A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes."

Present Perfect Simple: This tense is used to describe events that began in the past but still have relevance today, often to highlight the significance of previous research in an introduction.

Example: "Researchers of autonomous lane-following have come up with a multitude of techniques."

Past Simple: This tense is used to describe actions completed in the past, typically related to the execution of a project or experiment.

Example: "The team developed the tool and tested its effectiveness using a large dataset."

Using tenses appropriately is crucial when writing a computer science research paper.
