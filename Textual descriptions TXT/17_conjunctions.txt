
Conjunctions

Clauses are groups of words that contain a subject and a verb. Conjunctions are used to join clauses together to create more complex sentences and convey relationships between ideas. 

Types of conjunctions: There are two main types of conjunctions used to connect clauses:
a. Coordinating conjunctions: These conjunctions connect independent clauses (main clauses) with equal importance. Common coordinating conjunctions are "for," "and," "nor," "but," "or," "yet," and "so." You can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS.

b. Subordinating conjunctions: These conjunctions connect a dependent clause (which cannot stand alone) to an independent clause (which can stand alone). Examples of subordinating conjunctions include "because," "since," "although," "if," "when," "while," and "before."


Conjunctions play a crucial role in creating clear, coherent, and well-structured sentences by connecting clauses in the English language.
