Linking expressions
Prepositions, conjunctions, and transitions help connect ideas and make sentences clear.
1.	Prepositions connect noun phrases and show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence. They often indicate location, direction, time, or other relationships. For example: 
●	The data is stored in the database.
●	She is working on the software.
●	The algorithm runs faster with optimization.
In these examples, the prepositions 'in', 'on', and 'with' connect the noun phrases ('the database', 'the software', and 'optimization') to the rest of the sentence.
2.	Conjunctions are words that join two or more clauses (groups of words with a subject and verb). Common conjunctions include 'and', 'but', 'or', 'so', and 'because'. For example: 
●	The code is efficient and easy to read. 
●	The program crashed because there was a bug.
●	You can use Python or JavaScript for this project.
Here, the conjunctions 'and', 'because', and 'or' connect the clauses in each sentence.
3.	Transitions connect sentences by showing the relationship between sentences or paragraphs, making the text flow smoothly. They can indicate addition, contrast, cause and effect, or other connections. 
Example 1:
The programmer fixed the bug in the code. However, some performance issues still remained.
In this example, the transition 'However' connects the two sentences by showing a contrast between the bug being fixed and the remaining performance issues
Example 2:
The team implemented a new feature. As a result, the software became more versatile.
In this case, the transition 'As a result' connects the sentences by showing the cause and effect relationship between implementing a new feature and the software becoming more versatile.
