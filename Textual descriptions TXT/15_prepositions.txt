Prepositions

Noun phrases are groups of words with a noun as the main word.

For example: "the new language"

Prepositions show the relationship between the noun or pronoun and other words in the sentence. Common prepositions include "in," "on," "at," "with," "by," "for," "before," and "after."

You can add a noun phrase to a sentence to give more details about time, place, manner, or other relationships. For example:

Original: He found the bug. It took two hours.

With noun phrase: He found the bug after two hours.

Reasons to add a noun phrase:
a. Give more information: Noun phrases give extra details about languages, tools, or processes.

Example: "The developer made a new solution with Python, a helpful language."

b. Make sentences clear: Adding a noun phrase can make a computer science sentence easier to understand.

Example: "The group worked together on the project about machine learning."

c. Create variety: Noun phrases make talking about computer science more interesting and less boring.

Example: "The data person found important information from the big dataset with many data points."
