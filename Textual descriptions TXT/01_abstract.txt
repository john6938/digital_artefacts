Abstract

An abstract for a short research article summarizes the paper's content concisely and highlights its key points. It should be no more than 200 words, and generally includes the following components:


1.	Introduction (Move 1): Introduce the topic and its importance briefly. Example: "Recent advances in machine learning have led to a surge in deep learning algorithms, but training these models can be computationally expensive."
2.	Objective/Research Question (Move 2): State the main objective of your study. Example: "This study investigates techniques to reduce the computational costs of training deep learning models without sacrificing accuracy."
3.	Methodology (Move 3): Briefly describe the methods used. Example: "We implemented and compared three pruning algorithms on a popular deep learning architecture, ResNet-50, and evaluated their performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset."
4.	Results (Move 4): Summarize the main findings of your research. Example: "Our results show that algorithm A achieved up to 40% reduction in computational complexity, while maintaining comparable accuracy to the original model."
5.	Conclusion/Implications (Move 5): Conclude by stating the significance of the findings and their potential impact. Example: "The proposed pruning techniques can significantly reduce computational resources required for training deep learning models, enabling wider adoption in resource-constrained environments."
Remember to keep the language clear and concise, avoid jargon, and maintain a logical flow throughout the abstract
