    <h2>Prepositions</h2>

    <p><strong>Noun phrases</strong> are groups of words with a noun as the main word. For example: <em>"the new language"</em>. Prepositions show the relationship between the noun or pronoun and other words in the sentence. Common prepositions include "in," "on," "at," "with," "by," "for," "before," and "after." You can add a noun phrase to a sentence to give more details about time, place, manner, or other relationships. For example:</p>

    <p><strong>Original</strong>: He found the bug. It took two hours.</p>

    <p><strong>With noun phrase</strong>: He found the bug after two hours.</p>

    <p>Reasons to add a noun phrase:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give more information: Noun phrases give extra details about languages, tools, or processes. Example: "The developer made a new solution with Python, a helpful language."</li>

        <li>Make sentences clear: Adding a noun phrase can make a computer science sentence easier to understand. Example: "The group worked together on the project about machine learning."</li>

        <li>Create variety: Noun phrases make talking about computer science more interesting and less boring. Example: "The data person found important information from the big dataset with many data points."</li>
