    <h2>Linking Expressions</h2>
    <p>Prepositions, conjunctions, and transitions help connect ideas and make sentences clear.</p>

    <h3>1. Prepositions</h3>
    <p>Prepositions connect noun phrases and show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence. They often indicate location, direction, time, or other relationships. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The data is stored <em>in</em> the database.</li>
    	<li>She is working <em>on</em> the software.</li>
    	<li>The algorithm runs faster <em>with</em> optimization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In these examples, the prepositions 'in', 'on', and 'with' connect the noun phrases ('the database', 'the software', and 'optimization') to the rest of the sentence.</p>

    <h3>2. Conjunctions</h3>
    <p>Conjunctions are words that join two or more clauses (groups of words with a subject and verb). Common conjunctions include 'and', 'but', 'or', 'so', and 'because'. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The code is efficient <em>and</em> easy to read.</li>
    <li>The program crashed <em>because</em> there was a bug.</li>
    <li>You can use Python <em>or</em> JavaScript for this project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here, the conjunctions 'and', 'because', and 'or' connect the clauses in each sentence.</p>

    <h3>3. Transitions</h3>
    <p>Transitions connect sentences by showing the relationship between sentences or paragraphs, making the text flow smoothly. They can indicate addition, contrast, cause and effect, or other connections.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Example 1:</p>
        <p>The programmer fixed the bug in the code. <em>However</em>, some performance issues still remained.</p>
        <p>In this example, the transition 'However' connects the two sentences by showing a contrast between the bug being fixed and the remaining performance issues.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Example 2:</p>
        <p>The team implemented a new feature. <em>As a result</em>, the software became more versatile.</p>
        <p>In this case, the transition 'As a result' connects the sentences by showing the cause and effect relationship between implementing a new feature and the software becoming more versatile.</p>
    </blockquote>
