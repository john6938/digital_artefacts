    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>An abstract for a short research article summarizes the paper's content concisely and highlights its key points. It should be no more than 200 words, and generally includes the following components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction (Move 1):</strong> Introduce the topic and its importance briefly. Example: "Recent advances in machine learning have led to a surge in deep learning algorithms, but training these models can be computationally expensive."</li>
        <li><strong>Objective/Research Question (Move 2):</strong> State the main objective of your study. Example: "This study investigates techniques to reduce the computational costs of training deep learning models without sacrificing accuracy."</li>
        <li><strong>Methodology (Move 3):</strong> Briefly describe the methods used. Example: "We implemented and compared three pruning algorithms on a popular deep learning architecture, ResNet-50, and evaluated their performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset."</li>
        <li><strong>Results (Move 4):</strong> Summarize the main findings of your research. Example: "Our results show that algorithm A achieved up to 40% reduction in computational complexity, while maintaining comparable accuracy to the original model."</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion/Implications (Move 5):</strong> Conclude by stating the significance of the findings and their potential impact. Example: "The proposed pruning techniques can significantly reduce computational resources required for training deep learning models, enabling wider adoption in resource-constrained environments."</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember to keep the language clear and concise, avoid jargon, and maintain a logical flow throughout the abstract.</p>
