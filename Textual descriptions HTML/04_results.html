    <h2>Results section</h2>
    <p>Here are some steps to write a Results section for a Computer Science research paper:</p>

    <h3>1. State the Main Findings:</h3>
    <p>Start by outlining the key findings. This is where you'll provide the answers to the research question(s) you've set. For example, "Our developed algorithm successfully improved the efficiency of data sorting by 25%."</p>

    <h3>2. Provide Details:</h3>
    <p>Next, provide more detailed findings. You should provide context to your results, with specifics and accurate details. For example, "The algorithm's efficiency was tested by comparing its sorting time against that of the standard algorithm, using datasets of varying sizes. The developed algorithm showed a consistent 25% decrease in sorting time across all datasets."</p>

    <h3>3. Use Visual Aids:</h3>
    <p>In many cases, results are best presented visually. Graphs, charts, tables, and diagrams can illustrate the results in a more digestible format. For example, "As shown in Figure 1, the developed algorithm's sorting time (represented by the red line) was consistently lower than that of the standard algorithm (represented by the blue line) across all dataset sizes."</p>

    <h3>4. Describe Negative Results:</h3>
    <p>All results should be reported, even if they were not as expected or if they contradict your hypothesis. This is important for maintaining scientific integrity. For example, "While the developed algorithm showed improved efficiency in sorting, it consumed 15% more memory compared to the standard algorithm, as shown in Table 2."</p>

    <h3>5. Summarize the Findings:</h3>
    <p>End the Results section with a summary of the findings. This should be a brief recap of the main points. For example, "In summary, our developed algorithm improved the efficiency of data sorting by 25%, albeit at the cost of increased memory usage."</p>

    <h3>6. Do Not Interpret:</h3>
    <p>Remember, the Results section is not where you interpret your findings. That is the job of the Discussion section. Keep your opinions, implications, and interpretations out of the Results section.</p>

    <p>Here are some rhetorical moves to help present your results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Overview of Results:</strong> Provide a summary of the most significant findings. This gives the reader an initial understanding of the results.</li>
        <li><strong>Sequential Presentation:</strong> Present your results in a logical sequence that aligns with the methods you used to gather and analyze the data. This makes it easier for the reader to follow and understand your findings.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlighting Important Results:</strong> Highlight any results that are particularly important to your research question. This helps draw the reader's attention to key findings.</li>
        <li><strong>Explanation of Figures and Tables:</strong> Clearly explain the content of any figures, tables, or other visual aids you use. This ensures that the reader fully understands the data presented.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Lastly, remember to be clear and concise in your writing. Use plain language and avoid unnecessary jargon. The goal is to convey your findings in a way that is easy for the reader to understand.</p>
