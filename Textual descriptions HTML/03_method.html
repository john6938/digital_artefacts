    <h2>Method section</h2>
    <p>The method section of a research article in computer science provides a detailed description of the methodology and procedures used to conduct the study. It should enable other researchers to replicate the experiment or study and assess the validity of the results. Here are some typical rhetorical moves and a short computer science example for each category:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Research Design:</h3>
    <p>Clearly state the research design or approach used in the study.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "This study adopts an experimental research design to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison to existing methods."</p>

    <h3>2. Participants or Data Collection:</h3>
    <p>Describe the participants involved in the study or the data collection process.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "A total of 100 undergraduate students from various computer science programs were recruited as participants for the user study."</p>

    <h3>3. Variables and Measures:</h3>
    <p>Specify the variables studied and the measures used to collect data.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The independent variable in this study is the level of encryption (low, medium, high), and the dependent variable is the time taken to encrypt a file measured in milliseconds."</p>

    <h3>4. Experimental Setup or Software Environment:</h3>
    <p>Explain the experimental setup, hardware, software, or simulation environment used.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The experiments were conducted on a server with an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and Ubuntu 20.04 operating system. The programming language used was Python 3.9."</p>

    <h3>5. Data Collection Procedure:</h3>
    <p>Describe how the data was collected or experiments were conducted.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Participants were individually seated in front of a computer and provided with a set of instructions. They were then asked to perform a series of tasks using the proposed system while their interactions were recorded."</p>

    <h3>6. Data Analysis:</h3>
    <p>Outline the statistical or analytical methods employed to analyze the data.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Descriptive statistics, such as means and standard deviations, were calculated for each variable. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare the mean performance across different encryption levels."</p>

    <h3>7. Ethical Considerations:</h3>
    <p>Address any ethical considerations, such as informed consent or data privacy.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent before participating in the study. Participant data was anonymized and stored securely."</p>
