    <h2>Three main tenses</h2>

    <p>The most frequently used tenses and aspects in computer science writing are the present simple, present perfect simple, and past simple tenses. Here is an explanation for each tense's usage:</p>

    <h3>Present Simple:</h3>
    <p>This tense is used to discuss concepts that are true now and generally remain true. It helps readers understand fundamental ideas and current developments in computer science.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Example: "A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Present Perfect Simple:</h3>
    <p>This tense is used to describe events that began in the past but still have relevance today, often to highlight the significance of previous research in an introduction.</p>
