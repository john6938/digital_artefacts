    <h2>Hedges</h2>
    <p>Hedging in academic writing means using words to make your ideas less strong or direct. Some words used for hedging include <em>might</em>, <em>could</em>, <em>may</em>, <em>possibly</em>, <em>seems</em>, and <em>generally</em>.</p>
    <p>For example: "Traffic accidents <em>may</em> be reduced by the mass adoption of self-driving vehicles." or "This method <em>could</em> improve performance."</p>
    <p>In computer science academic writing, hedging is used because researchers want to be accurate and careful when sharing their findings. This field is complex, and sometimes there are different ways to solve a problem or new information that can change our understanding of things. By using hedging, writers show they are open to other ideas and avoid making statements that are too strong or certain. This helps create a respectful and thoughtful conversation among researchers.</p>
