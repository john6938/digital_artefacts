    <h2>Passive voice</h2>

    <p>The passive voice makes sentences in English where the action is more important than who does it. For example:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Weights were initialized using He initialization.</li>
        <li>ANOVAs were conducted to confirm the instrumentâ€™s validity.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In computer science academic writing, people often use the passive voice to focus on the process, the results, or the research, not on who did the work. Using passive voice helps make the writing more objective.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example of process: The software was updated to fix the bug.</li>
        <li>Example of results: The test accuracy was improved by 10%.</li>
        <li>Example focusing on research: The model was trained using a large dataset.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Using passive voice in this way helps to emphasize the important parts of the research and keeps the focus on the ideas, not the people.</p>

    <p>However, not all verbs can be used in the passive voice. Verbs that don't have an object, called intransitive verbs, cannot be made passive. This is because there is no object to move to the subject position in the sentence.</p>

    <p>For example, intransitive verbs like "sleep," "arrive," and "laugh" cannot be used in the passive voice because they don't have an object to play the role of subject in the sentence.</p>

    <p>So, remember that only verbs with an object, called transitive verbs, can be used in the passive voice.</p>
