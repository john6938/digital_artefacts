    <h2>Conjunctions</h2>

    <p>Clauses are groups of words that contain a subject and a verb. Conjunctions are used to join clauses together to create more complex sentences and convey relationships between ideas.</p>

    <h3>Types of conjunctions:</h3> 
    <p>There are two main types of conjunctions used to connect clauses:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Coordinating conjunctions:</strong> These conjunctions connect independent clauses (main clauses) with equal importance. Common coordinating conjunctions are: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. You can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS.</li>
        <li><strong>Subordinating conjunctions:</strong> These conjunctions connect a dependent clause (which cannot stand alone) to an independent clause (which can stand alone). Examples of subordinating conjunctions include: because, since, although, if, when, while, and before.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Conjunctions play a crucial role in creating clear, coherent, and well-structured sentences by connecting clauses in the English language.</p>
