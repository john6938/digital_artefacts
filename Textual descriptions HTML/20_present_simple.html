	<h2>Present simple</h2>
	
    <p>In computer science academic writing, we use the present simple tense to explain basic concepts, describe the current state of a technology, or discuss widely accepted theories. Here are some examples related to computer science academic writing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Data is stored in databases.</li>
        <li>An algorithm solves a problem.</li>
        <li>A computer processes information.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We use the present simple tense in computer science academic writing for these reasons:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>To explain general facts that are true in general in computer science. This helps readers understand the basic ideas and theories.</li>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Example: Machine learning models learn from data.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <li>To describe current states, properties, features or characteristics of a technology or system at the time of writing. This helps readers understand what is happening in the field of computer science.</li>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Example: A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <li>To discuss widely accepted theories or principles that are commonly accepted in the field of computer science. This helps readers understand the foundation of the subject.</li>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Example: "Information travels through networks using the Internet Protocol."</p>
        </blockquote>
    </ol>

    <p>In summary, the present simple tense is used in computer science academic writing to explain general facts, describe current states or properties, and discuss widely accepted theories.</p>
