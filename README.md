AI-generated digital artefacts (GloCALL 2023)

**Abstract**

Quality feedback is crucial for learning, with metalinguistic explanations being one method to deliver feedback. Despite rapid advancement, the ability for AI to generate digital artefacts which can be used as metalinguistic explanations has not been investigated. This study investigates the feasibility of creating metalinguistic explanations for textual features using ChatGPT and other AI tools. The following artefacts were generated using AI: metalinguistic explanations; scripts suitable for text-to-speech engines, and slideshows with accompanying voiceovers. Suitability of each digital artefact was reviewed by teachers. A poka-yoke error-proofing approach to quality management was adopted to identify pitfalls and problems in the production pipeline. Results show high quality metalinguistic explanations were able to be produced efficiently using AI. We reveal three specific ways to streamline the workflow, creating a process that is less error-prone. Incorporation of these digital artefacts into genre analysis tasks and feedback on student drafts are discussed.
